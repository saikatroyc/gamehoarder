gamehoarder webapp to manage game collections
The Game Hoarder project is a web application that 
allows users to keep track of their game collections. Users are able to searchfor games in a database crawled from online game databases and add them to their personal collections. Users are also able to rate their games and gather various statistics on their game collection (such as the number of games, the number of complete/incomplete games, etc.). Finally, users can get recommendations based on the games that they own and the games that are popular among other users of the website.
